## Abstract

The experimental observation of Floquet states in sub‑micrometric magnetic vortices under weak magnonic excitation represents a conceptual shift in non‑equilibrium physics. Rather than relying on high‑energy laser forcing, these results reveal that coherent, low‑amplitude excitation is sufficient to induce stable, discrete dynamical regimes. This whitepaper interprets these findings as manifestations of toroidal electromagnetic systems capable of adaptive reconfiguration when symmetry is lost.

By integrating Floquet dynamics with the Theory of Learning by Exception (TAE) and the METFI framework, we propose that such systems do not merely respond to stimuli but *select* new operational states when confronted with resonant exceptions. This logic is shown to be formally invariant across scales, from nanomagnetic vortices to biological and planetary systems.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional approaches to non‑equilibrium control assume that new dynamical regimes require increased energetic input. Recent results from the Helmholtz‑Zentrum Dresden‑Rossendorf challenge this assumption by demonstrating that weak, coherent excitation suffices when structural resonance is achieved.

This observation forces a reconsideration of how complex systems transition between stable regimes, suggesting that topology and phase coherence dominate over raw energy.

---

## 2. Floquet Theory Beyond Linear Periodicity

Floquet theory classically addresses linear systems with time‑periodic Hamiltonians. However, real magnetic vortices exhibit internal topology, memory, and non‑linearity. The observed Floquet states therefore represent *emergent discrete attractors* rather than trivial periodic solutions.

> [!NOTE]
> In such systems, time effectively becomes discretized, functioning as an operational lattice.

---

## 3. Magnetic Vortices as Toroidal Systems

Magnetic vortices are characterized by closed circulation of magnetization around a core, forming a toroidal electromagnetic architecture. This geometry supports internal modes that can store and redistribute energy coherently.

Loss of perfect symmetry does not destabilize the system; instead, it opens channels for discrete reorganization.

---

## 4. Weak Magnonic Excitation and Structural Resonance

The Dresden experiments demonstrate that magnonic waves tuned to internal frequencies trigger Floquet states without destructive forcing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The system responds not to amplitude, but to *coherence*.

This principle mirrors resonance phenomena across biological and geophysical systems.

---

## 5. Learning by Exception (TAE): Physical Formalization

TAE posits that learning occurs when a system encounters a perturbation incompatible with its existing operational regime. In physical terms:

* Periodic excitation defines a stimulus
* Structural resonance defines the exception
* A Floquet state defines the learned configuration

This transforms learning from a cognitive metaphor into a physical principle.

---

## 6. Temporal Discretization and Dynamic Memory

Floquet states encode memory dynamically rather than statically. Stability emerges from repetition, phase locking, and coherence over cycles.

This mechanism parallels neural oscillations, cardiac rhythms, and endocrine cycles.

---

## 7. METFI Correspondence Across Scales

METFI models the Earth as a toroidal electromagnetic system with internal forcing. Loss of toroidal symmetry leads to non‑linear transitions—formally identical to those observed in magnetic vortices.

> [!CAUTION]
> Scale differs; structure does not.

---

## 8. Bioelectromagnetic and Genetic Extensions

Genetic regulation and cellular communication exhibit rhythmic, field‑mediated behavior. DNA, as a charged helical structure, interacts continuously with endogenous electromagnetic fields.

Floquet‑like stabilization offers a framework for understanding persistent epigenetic states without invoking sequence changes.

## 9. Programs of Seguimiento

### 9.1 Magnetic Systems

* Phase‑resolved tracking of Floquet stability
* Topological analysis during symmetry loss

### 9.2 Biological Systems

* Seguimiento of coherent EM fields in tissues
* Correlation between oscillatory regimes and gene expression windows

### 9.3 Planetary Systems

* Analysis of internal EM resonances
* Seguimiento of discrete geophysical transitions

---

## 10. Integrative Discussion

Across all examined systems, a unifying principle emerges: coherent periodic forcing acting on toroidal architectures produces discrete adaptive states. Matter, under these conditions, behaves as a learning system.

---

## Final Summary

* Floquet states can be stabilized by weak coherent excitation
* Topology and phase dominate over energy magnitude
* Magnetic vortices function as toroidal learning systems
* TAE provides a formal learning framework for physical systems
* METFI extends this logic to planetary‑scale dynamics
* Biological and genetic processes align with this architecture
