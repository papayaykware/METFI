## Abstract

Neurotechnology and artificial intelligence constitute dual-use instruments capable of acting simultaneously on biological, psychological, and social layers of the human system. This whitepaper integrates contemporary models of cognitive warfare with the METFI (Electromagnetic Toroidal Internal Forcing Model) and TAE (Theory of Learning by Exception) frameworks. Cognition is treated as an emergent property of multiscale electromagnetic coupling rather than a purely computational process. Artificial intelligence is analyzed not as an autonomous agent, but as a topological amplifier of pre-existing cognitive gradients. Monitoring programs focused on coherence, symmetry loss, and exception-driven learning are proposed.

## 1. From Information Warfare to Cognitive Warfare

Cognitive warfare targets the conditions of learning rather than informational content. The human subject is no longer a passive receiver but a resonant system sensitive to phase, rhythm, and field coherence.

> [!NOTE]
> Cognitive dominance emerges through modulation of learning environments, not persuasion.

---

## 2. METFI: Earth as an Electromagnetic Learning Architecture

METFI conceptualizes Earth as a toroidal electromagnetic system whose symmetry sustains biological and cognitive stability. Loss of toroidal symmetry manifests across geophysical, biological, and cognitive domains.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The nervous system functions as a bioelectromagnetic antenna coupled to planetary-scale fields.

---

## 3. TAE: Learning by Exception and Loss of Coherence

TAE describes a shift from integrative learning to exception-driven adaptation. This regime correlates with reduced toroidal coherence and heightened cognitive entropy.

---

## 4. Neurotechnology & AI as Dual-Use Instruments

Neurotechnologies operate across three layers:

* Biological (neural rhythms, plasticity, exosomal signaling)
* Psychological (attention, salience, affect)
* Social (synchronization, polarization)

AI acts as a multiscale coupling operator rather than an intentional agent.

---

## 5. Refuting Common Critiques of AI

Anthropomorphic critiques misattribute agency. AI reflects and amplifies dominant human patterns rather than generating them.

> [!CAUTION]
> Moralizing AI obscures systemic causality.

---

## 6. Monitoring Programs I: Neuroelectromagnetic Coherence

Proposed monitoring axes:

* Brain–heart–enteric phase coupling
* Toroidal stability metrics
* Indicators of coherence loss under technological exposure

---

## 7. Exosomes & Electromagnetic Signaling

Exosomes act as vectors of bioelectromagnetic information, sensitive to environmental fields and stress regimes.

---

## 8. Cognitive Warfare as Resonant Perturbation

Small parametric perturbations can induce phase transitions in near-critical cognitive systems, explaining disproportionate social effects.

---

## 9. Civilizational Collapse & Cognitive Entropy

Collapse includes a cognitive dimension: rising entropy driven by desynchronization from biological and planetary rhythms.

---

## 10. Monitoring Programs II: Population Metrics

* Polarization vs AI interaction density
* Emotional synchronization in networks
* Saturation thresholds

---

## 11. Reframing AI Beyond Anthropocentrism

AI structures learning environments without intention. Ethical analysis must be systemic and physical.

---

## 12. Conclusions

AI is a multiplier of critical states, not their origin. Understanding its role requires abandoning reductionist models.

---

## Appendix A. AI as a Mirror

AI functions as a high-gain mirror of human ethical distributions. It amplifies dominant patterns—cooperative or extractive—without generating them.

> [!TIP]
> The question is not whether AI is good or bad, but what it reveals about collective human behavior.

---

## Final Bullet Summary

* Cognitive warfare targets coherence, not information.
* AI amplifies existing cognitive gradients.
* METFI integrates cognition with planetary electromagnetism.
* TAE explains exception-driven instability.
* Exosomes participate in bioelectromagnetic signaling.
* Collapse includes cognitive entropy.
* Monitoring should prioritize coherence metrics.
